# Security Model

Big Bang implements a comprehensive, defense-in-depth security model aligned with industry standards and the DoD DevSecOps Reference Architecture. This document outlines the security principles, controls, and implementations that protect applications and data throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Overview

Big Bang's security model is built on zero-trust principles and implements multiple layers of security controls to ensure comprehensive protection. The platform addresses security concerns across the entire application lifecycle, from supply chain integrity through runtime protection. Much of the security functionality works out-of-the-box, while also allowing for customization to meet specific organizational requirements. Since the Big Bang team uses Big Bang, many of the security features are continuously tested and improved in real-world scenarios, and then passed on to users.

### Core Security Principles

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layered security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**: Minimal necessary access rights
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security observability
- **Supply Chain Security**: End-to-end integrity verification
- **Compliance by Design**: Built-in regulatory compliance

## Security Architecture

### 1. Service Mesh Security

Big Bang leverages Istio service mesh to provide comprehensive network security:

**Mutual TLS (mTLS)**
- Automatic encryption of all service-to-service communication
