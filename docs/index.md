# Big Bang

Big Bang is a declarative, continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that enables secure, compliant, and repeatable deployments of cloud-native applications. Built on GitOps principles and designed for enterprise and government environments, Big Bang provides a comprehensive platform for deploying and managing modern applications at scale.

## What is Big Bang?

Big Bang is an umbrella Helm chart that packages together a collection of open-source and commercial software tools into a cohesive platform. It leverages Flux CD for GitOps-based deployments and provides:

- **Zero Trust Security**: Built-in security controls with defense-in-depth architecture
- **Compliance by Design**: Implementation of the DoD DevSecOps Reference Architecture and industry standards
- **Observability Stack**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities
- **Service Mesh**: Istio-based secure service-to-service communication
- **Developer Experience**: Integrated CI/CD pipelines and development tools
